# How to run the project on localhost

- Install Download Node.js
- navigate to this project folder with cmd (or just use the Node.js Command Prompt that comes with it)
- Use command "npm install" to install all dependencies, make sure the "package.json" is at the root(which should already is)
- Use commant "npm start" to run the server(default is localhost:8000, as defined in the /bin/.www file, you can change it to other ports if you want at the file).
